# WorkInProgress
Following projects are WIP
##### Exec Family Hook
Hooks exec family functions to extrace all build commands with enviournment variables. It can be further enhanced to create compilation_database.json file.
##### Record and replay
Our aim with this project is to record gameplay on android device and perform frame perfect replay. If it is done then we can earn virtul money while sleeping. 

Challanges: /dev/input/ files does not provide any vsync data to mimic frame perfect replay.
